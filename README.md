<h3 align="center">🎥 Real-Time Object Detection</h3>

This project implements a real-time object detection system using webcam input, TensorFlow.js for detecting objects, and Next.js 14 with Tailwind CSS for the user interface. It detects objects (like people), renders bounding boxes on a canvas, and plays audio feedback when specific objects are detected.

<h2>🚀 Features</h2>

1. Real-Time Object Detection: Detects objects like people, animals, and more from a live webcam feed. 👀
2. Bounding Box Rendering: Draws boxes around detected objects on an HTML canvas. 📦
3. Audio Feedback: Plays a sound (e.g., meme or notification) when a person is detected. 🔊
4. Optimized Audio Playback: Throttles audio playback to prevent overlapping sounds. 🎶

<h2>💻 Tech Stack</h2>

1. Next.js 14: Framework for building the app with React. ⚛️
2. Tailwind CSS: For styling the UI with utility classes. 🎨
3. TensorFlow.js: Used for object detection with the COCO-SSD model. 🤖
4. Lodash: Provides the throttle function to control audio playback frequency. ⚡
5. HTML5 Canvas: For rendering bounding boxes and labels. 🖼️
